In today's data-driven world, the ability to interact with databases through natural language has become increasingly valuable. Enter **MCP Server for MySQL** - a powerful tool that bridges the gap between Large Language Models (LLMs) like Claude and your MySQL databases.

This innovative tool enables LLMs to:
- Inspect database schemas
- Execute SQL queries directly
- Analyze data without manual copying
- Perform database operations through natural language commands

Whether you're a developer looking to streamline your database interactions, a data analyst seeking more intuitive ways to query data, or a database administrator wanting to leverage AI for database management, **[MCP Server for MySQL](https://github.com/benborla/mcp-server-mysql)** offers a seamless solution.

### What is MCP?

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a framework that extends the capabilities of LLMs, allowing them to interact with external tools and systems. In this case, MCP Server for MySQL acts as a connector between LLMs and MySQL databases.

### Key Features

- **SQL Query Execution**: Send SQL queries directly to your MySQL database from your conversations with Claude
- **Schema Inspection**: Allow Claude to understand your database structure without manual explanations
- **Data Analysis**: Have Claude analyze your database data and return insights
- **Security Features**: 
  - SQL injection prevention through prepared statements
  - Configurable write permissions (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
  - Query whitelisting and rate limiting capabilities
  - Configurable connection encryption

### Performance Features

- Optimized connection pooling
- Query result caching
- Large result set streaming
- Query execution plan analysis
- Configurable query timeouts

### Use Cases

- **Database Exploration**: Ask Claude to explain complex database structures
- **Query Generation**: Request specific data without writing SQL yourself
- **Data Analysis**: Have Claude analyze patterns or insights from your database
- **Database Maintenance**: When configured, allow Claude to help update or clean your data

## Installation

Getting started with MCP Server for MySQL is straightforward, with multiple installation methods available depending on your environment and preferences.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v18 or higher
- MySQL 5.7 or higher (MySQL 8.0+ recommended)
- MySQL user with appropriate permissions

### Installation Options


#### Using Claude Desktop

For Claude Desktop App, add the following to your `claude_desktop_config.json` file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp_server_mysql": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@benborla29/mcp-server-mysql"
      ],
      "env": {
        "MYSQL_HOST": "127.0.0.1",
        "MYSQL_PORT": "3306",
        "MYSQL_USER": "your_username",
        "MYSQL_PASS": "your_password",
        "MYSQL_DB": "your_database",
        "ALLOW_INSERT_OPERATION": "false",
        "ALLOW_UPDATE_OPERATION": "false",
        "ALLOW_DELETE_OPERATION": "false",
        "PATH": "/path/to/node/bin:/usr/bin:/bin",
        "NODE_PATH": "/path/to/node/lib/node_modules"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### For Cursor IDE (Version: 0.47+)

Add this to your `mcp.json`
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "MySQL": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcprunner",
        "MYSQL_HOST=127.0.0.1",
        "MYSQL_PORT=3306",
        "MYSQL_USER=root",
        "MYSQL_PASS=root",
        "MYSQL_DB=demostore",
        "ALLOW_INSERT_OPERATION=true",
        "ALLOW_UPDATE_OPERATION=true",
        "ALLOW_DELETE_OPERATION=false",
        "--",
        "npx",
        "-y",
        "@benborla29/mcp-server-mysql"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
If you have a lower version you may use this
```
npx mcprunner MYSQL_HOST=127.0.0.1 MYSQL_PORT=3306 MYSQL_USER=root MYSQL_PASS=root MYSQL_DB=demostore ALLOW_INSERT_OPERATION=true ALLOW_UPDATE_OPERATION=true ALLOW_DELETE_OPERATION=false -- npx -y @benborla29/mcp-server-mysql
```
Remember to replace the values in the `env` strings.
